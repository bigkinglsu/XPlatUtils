# XPlatUtils

A set of extremely helpful "helper" classes for cross platform apps. Including a very simple IoC container and messenger implementation using weak references.

I also include some iOS-specific code snippets for UITableView as well as Visual Studio hotkeys for Xamarin Studio.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/jonathanpeppers/XPlatUtils/wiki) for more information.
